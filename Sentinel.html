        <h1 class="vibe2"><u>Brief info about me:</u> </h1>
        <p class="animated-text"> My name is Nana Kow Essel-Tetteh. I'm a citizen of Ghana of Nzema and Fante heritage who completed secondary school at Presec Legon.
            I'm currently offering computer Engineering at KNUST. Although I'm resident at Lienda Ville Hostel which is off campus, I spend 
            most of my time on campus with my friends studying, gamimg and performing other interesting activities. My passion for computer Engineering originated from childhood.
            I developed an intense interest in computers (both the software and hardware aspects) and had the desire to learn more about it. I have always
            been fascinated by the design of computer systems, algorithms of software and emerging technology such as AI and Machine Learning. And it
            is my dream to be the best that I can be in this field and make life easier for the world with my innovations.
